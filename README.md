Dog vs. Cat Image Classification
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify images of dogs and cats using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The project involves image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Project Overview
This project includes the following steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Resize images to a uniform size.
Assign labels to images.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Normalize the image data.
Load a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
Build and compile the final model.
Train and evaluate the model.
Make predictions on new images.
Save and load the trained model for future use.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images of dogs and cats. The images are stored in the data directory. The images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size required by the MobileNetV2 model.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy
Pandas
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
